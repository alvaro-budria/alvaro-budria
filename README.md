- 👋 Hi, I’m Álvaro F. Budría @alvaro-budria
- 👀 I’m interested in what happens at the intersection between Machine Learning, Databases and Data Analysis: Big (distributed) Data!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all about Data Science at UPC, Barcelona, where I am currently enrolled on a Data Science degree.
     Right now I am also taking a smaller course on cloud computing through Azure, and another course on BigData analysis with Scala and Spark.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Data Analysis projects with a focus on Distributed Databases or Data Warehousing
- 📫 Feel free to contact me if you have any question or proposal :slightly_smiling_face:
